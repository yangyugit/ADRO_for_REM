The core code of the manuscript-"Adaptive Distributionally Robust Optimization for Residential Energy Management Considering Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainties in Renewable Generation and Energy Demand" submitted to IEEE ACCESS. 

The core code is realized in Matlab R2021b, requires YALMIP and Gurobi toolbox. 

The main program is adro_experiment.m. 
Running it in MATLAB reproduces all the results presented in this manuscript. 
The code will be further enhanced and extended to support community-level energy dispatch in future work.
